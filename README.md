## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
I took inspiration for the app from the website https://www.adoptapet.com/ for adopting pets.
My app just focuses on finding a dog to adopt from a given list.  

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
Given that I found out and started learning Jetpack Compose only last Saturday, I am happy 
how Pet Details Screen came out to look. I have also included a button link to the adoptapet.com 
web page for a given dog, to actually be able to adopt. 
I am proud of completing my first Android app, from start to finish. I have been trying to learn, off and on,
Android development for about a year now. Introduction of Jetpack Compose just made it so much more fun
and enjoyable.
